Hacking CompilerKit
===================
## Status
- [Ohloh tracker](https://www.ohloh.net/p/CompilerKit)

## Getting started
1. Install the dependencies for your platform.
    - [Windows](#what-to-install-on-windows)
    - [Linux](#what-to-install-on-linux)
    - [Mac](#what-to-install-on-mac)
2. [Fork the project here.](https://github.com/lawrancej/CompilerKit/fork)
3. [Learn how to contribute.](#how-to-contribute)
4. [Build CompilerKit.](#how-do-i-build-compilerkit)
5. [Read Documentation.](#where-is-the-documentation)

## How to contribute
1. Find something to work on:
    * [Check the issue tracker](https://github.com/lawrancej/CompilerKit/issues)
      Comment on the issue to get dibs.
    * [Check the coordination document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7SXO8BSL5rq2cJVqp_9XfWkzNyi9ZWKKl2Heb_nS1g/edit?pli=1)
2. [Add your improvements to a branch named for the issue.](#getting-your-branched-merged-checklist)
3. [Send in a pull request.](https://github.com/lawrancej/CompilerKit/pull/new/master)
4. Profit!

Or, [file a bug report.](https://github.com/lawrancej/CompilerKit/issues/new)

## Getting your branch merged checklist
### Use topic branches for your work
Topic branches isolate chunks of work so that it's easier for others to merge in.

 1. Create a new branch:
     `git checkout -b issueXYZ`
 2. Hack away, making commits along the way.
 3. Push your issue branch to github:
     `git push origin issueXYZ`
 4. Switch to that branch in github, and send in a pull request for feedback.

Sometimes, it's necessary to switch between branches. Your work will always be saved.

 - To switch back to master:
    `git checkout master`
 - To see the branches:
    `git branch`

### Test your changes
I will not merge code into my master branch until it has passing test cases in the test suite.
If the changes include documentation, then [ensure the documentation looks as expected](#where-is-the-documentation).
If the changes include code, ensure it works.

#### If the code is a demo

1. Ensure the [project builds successfully.](#how-do-i-build-compilerkit)
2. Ensure the demo works.

#### If the code is not a demo

1. Write test cases for your code.
2. Add test cases to the test suite.
3. Ensure the [project builds successfully.](#how-do-i-build-compilerkit)
4. Ensure the test suite passes.

## What to install on Windows
You will need to download and install everything manually.
Therefore, verify everything is working first before building CompilerKit.

 - Visual Studio 2010 or [MinGW](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files)
 - [Git (version control).](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - [CMake.](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
 - [Doxygen.](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc)
 - [GLib and GObject.](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24/gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32.zip) Extract to `C:\glib`. Add `C:\glib\bin` to the system PATH.

### How do I know it's working?
Open Git Bash to the `CompilerKit` folder. Type in the first line. Did you see the rest? You should.
```
pkg-config --list-all
gio-2.0               GIO - glib I/O library
gmodule-2.0           GModule - Dynamic module loader for GLib
glib-2.0              GLib - C Utility Library
gmodule-no-export-2.0 GModule - Dynamic module loader for GLib
gthread-2.0           GThread - Thread support for GLib
gobject-2.0           GObject - GLib Type, Object, Parameter and Signal Library
```

Did you see `command not found` after typing these into Git Bash? You should not.

 - `doxygen`
 - `cmake`

## What to install on Linux
In the terminal, paste this in for your distribution:

### Red Hat:

    sudo yum install git cmake doxygen glib-devel pkgconfig

### Debian, Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install git cmake doxygen libglib2.0-dev pkg-config

## What to install on Mac
If you do not already have it, install:

 - [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) or [Xcode](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090)
 - [Java Developer Update](https://connect.apple.com)

In the terminal, paste this in:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"
    
Once installed, paste this into the Terminal:

    brew install git cmake doxygen glib pkg-config

## How do I build CompilerKit?
CompilerKit builds with CMake. 

The first time you build, do this:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

For subsequent builds, in the `build` folder, just run `cmake --build .`

## Where is the documentation?
After building CompilerKit, look inside the `docs/html` folder.

Also, read up on [GLib](#how-do-i-use-glib) and [GObject](#how-do-i-use-gobject).

What is Doxygen:
It is a generator "a programming tool generates programming languages" for many programming languages. Also, it can configure to extract the code structure from undocumented source file. It supports C++, C, java, Python … etc. It will create documentation in HTML, LATEX, RTF (MS-Word).

## How do I use GLib?
GLib is a C utility library similar to the Standard Template Library in C++. It provides data structures as well as [GObject](#how-do-i-use-gobject).

To use it, read these first:

* [Documentation for GLib](http://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/)
* [GLib Hash table tutorial](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/tutorials/l-glib/section5.html)

## What do the GObject macros mean?
Let's compare with some examples.

```
GObject                                Java/C#
(prefix everything with COMPILERKIT)   package CompilerKit;
COMPILERKIT_IS_ALTERNATION(obj)        (obj instanceof Alternation)
COMPILERKIT_ALTERNATION (obj)          (Alternation) obj
COMPILERKIT_TYPE_ALTERNATION           Alternation.class
G_OBJECT_TYPE (obj)                    obj.getClass()
```

## How do I use GObject?
GObject may seem intimidating. Learn how it works, and realize that OOP languages provide a lot of shortcuts that C exposes to the programmer.

To use GObject, read these first:

* [GObject Tutorial](http://syscall.org/doku.php/gobjectutorial/start)
* [GObject FAQ](http://irrepupavel.com/documents/gtk/gobject-faq.html)
* [GObject Documentation](http://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/)

## How do I write GObject classes?
Run `./generate.sh`, and follow the instructions.
