/**
 * \page regular Regular language classes
 * 
 * Regular expressions and finite automata define and recognize regular languages.
 * * Regular expressions define the regular languages.
 * * Finite automata recognize regular languages.
 * * Scanners tokenize strings using finite automata or regular expressions. 
 * 
 * \section regex Regular Expressions
 * 
 * Regular expressions consist of:
 * 
 * * The empty set (CompilerKitEmptySet)
 * * The empty string (CompilerKitEmptyString)
 * * A symbol (CompilerKitSymbol)
 * * Concatenation (CompilerKitConcatenation)
 * * Alternation (CompilerKitAlternation)
 * * Kleene closure (CompilerKitKleeneStar)
 * * Complement (CompilerKitComplement)
 * 
 * For example, the regular expression `(a|ab)*` is: `Kleene Star (Alternation (Symbol (a), Concatenation (a, b)))`
 * 
 * \section fsm Finite Automata
 * 
 * A finite automaton is a machine that can be in only one of a finite number of states.
 * 
 * It has:
 * * A start state
 * * A set of states
 * * A set of accepting states
 * * A set of transitions from (state, symbol) to *something*.
 * 
 * In a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), *something* is the next state.
 * In a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), *something* is the set of possible next states.
